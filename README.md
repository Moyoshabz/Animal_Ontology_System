# Animal Ontology Reasoning System
## Live Demo
**Try the app here:** [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://animalontologysystem-rbyc9n4q8pwtkc4nvxwunw.streamlit.app/)

This project demonstrates how **ontological engineering** and **reasoning systems** can be applied in AI using Python, Streamlit, and the Owlready2 library.

## What It Does
- Builds a basic **ontology of animals** (Animal → Bird → Penguin, etc.)
- Models **category-based inference** (e.g., "Penguin is a Bird and thus an Animal")
- Implements **default logic** (e.g., "birds can fly", with exceptions like penguins)
- Provides an **interactive web app** to explore and reason about the ontology

## The Key Concepts
- **Ontological Engineering**
- **Semantic Reasoning**
- **Inheritance & Exception Handling**
- **AI Knowledge Representation**

## Tech Stack Used for this Project
- Python 3
- Owlready2
- Streamlit online app
- Google Colab 

## Why This Matters
This project showcases how structured semantic knowledge can support AI in making intelligent, explainable decisions, its application is critical in domains like **healthcare**, **education**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **smart online assistants**.

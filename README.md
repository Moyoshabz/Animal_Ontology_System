# Animal Ontology Reasoning System

This project demonstrates how **ontological engineering** and **reasoning systems** can be applied in AI using Python and the Owlready2 library.

## What It Does
- Defines a basic **ontology of animals** (Animal → Bird → Penguin, etc.)
- Encodes **category-based reasoning**
- Shows **default logic** in action (e.g., birds usually fly, penguins don’t)
- Uses **Owlready2** to load, extend, and query the ontology

## Key Concepts
- **Ontological Engineering**
- **Semantic Reasoning**
- **Inheritance & Exception Handling**
- **AI Knowledge Representation**

## Tech Stack Used
- Python 3
- Owlready2
- Google Colab (for interactive demos)

## Why This Matters
This project showcases how structured semantic knowledge can support AI in making intelligent, explainable decisions — a critical capability in domains like healthcare, education, and NLP.
